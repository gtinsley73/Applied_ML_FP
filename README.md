# Applied_ML_FP
Final Project for Applied Machine Learning Class

This set of notebooks contains the final project for an Applied Machine Learning class.  In it we were given a Kaggle dataset and ask to make multiple ML pipelines,
tune the hyper-parameters, and then evaluate the best model as if presenting to management.
